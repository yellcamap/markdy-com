# Changelog

All notable changes to the `markdy` project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **`<Markdy />` scenes now auto-play reliably on every page navigation, even
  through Cloudflare Rocket Loader.** When the host site enabled Rocket Loader
  (the default on many Cloudflare plans), the script Astro emits for the
  Markdy island had its `type="module"` attribute mangled to a hash-prefixed
  type (e.g. `abc123-module`) on SPA navigations performed by
  `<ClientRouter />`. The browser then refused to execute it, and the
  rocket-loader runtime did not always re-execute scripts added after the
  initial page load. The visible symptom was every scene stuck on the
  `▶ markdy` placeholder after navigating from a page without `<Markdy />`
  to one that uses it (e.g. clicking a locale switcher then a post link).
  The fix adds `data-cfasync="false"` to the island's `<script>` so Rocket
  Loader skips it entirely.
- **First scene in an article hydrates immediately instead of waiting for the
  IntersectionObserver.** `initAll()` now performs a viewport check on every
  unhydrated `.markdy-root` element and hydrates the ones already on-screen
  synchronously. Previously the observer used `{ threshold: 1.0 }`, which
  never fired for scenes taller than the viewport (common on narrow / mobile
  screens), leaving them frozen on the placeholder. The observer threshold is
  lowered to `0` so partial visibility is enough to trigger hydration.

### Added
- **Click-to-play fallback on the `.markdy-placeholder`.** If hydration is
  somehow skipped (third-party script blocker, broken `IntersectionObserver`,
  CSP edge case, etc.) clicking the placeholder forces hydration with
  `autoplay = true`. The handler is delegated on `document` so it survives
  Astro view-transition DOM swaps and is added even before `initAll()` runs.
  The placeholder also picks up `cursor: pointer` so this affordance is
  visible.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Expressive Character Actions** — Introduced high-level gesture and movement actions for `figure` actors in `@markdy/renderer-dom`. These simplify animation logic by replacing complex part rotation chains:
    - `jump(height, dur)`: Natural jumping motion with squash and stretch.
    - `bounce(intensity, count, dur)`: Diminishing vertical bounce effect.
    - `wave(side, dur)`: Context-aware waving gesture (oscillates specified arm).
    - `nod(dur)`: Intuitive head-nodding gesture.
    - `pose({ arms, legs, ... }, dur)`: Set multiple body part rotations simultaneously in a single command.
- **Layering Support** — Added `z` modifier to actors, allowing explicit control over rendering order (z-index) within a scene.
- **Theme-Aware Playground** — The website playground now automatically adapts scene background colors when switching between Light and Dark modes.

### Fixed
- **UI Contrast** — Adjusted `text-muted` color variables on the website for improved accessibility and readability in both themes.
- Updated documentation and playground examples to showcase new gestures and layering capabilities.

## [0.5.8] — 2026-04-12


### Fixed
- **Backslash-escaped variable interpolation** — `\${varname}` (the form produced by `String.raw` template literals in MDX) is now correctly resolved by the parser. Previously, only `${varname}` was matched, causing scenes embedded in MDX via `<Markdy code={String.raw\`...\`} />` to silently fail when using `var`, `def`, or `seq` features. The fix applies to all interpolation paths: var declarations, actor args/positions, event params, scene properties, def body templates, and seq body params.
- Added 10 new regression tests covering backslash-escaped vars across every parser code path.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Dark mode text contrast** — `text` actors and speech bubbles no longer inherit the page's dark-mode body color when rendered inside a light-background scene.
- Speech bubbles now explicitly set `color: "#222"` so text is always readable against the white bubble background regardless of OS/browser theme.
- Added `bgToTextColor()` helper in `@markdy/renderer-dom`: computes perceived luminance (ITU-R BT.601) from the scene `bg` color and sets a contrasting `color` on the scene root element. `text` actors inherit this automatically — `#1a1a1a` on light scenes, `#f0f0f0` on dark scenes.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Extracted `totalDurationMs` as a single constant in `createPlayer` — eliminates three redundant `(ast.meta.duration ?? 0) * 1000` recalculations per frame in the rAF tick loop.

### Changed
- Release script now also bumps the root `package.json` version alongside package versions.

### Website
- Added `theme-color` meta tags for light (`#fafafa`) and dark (`#0f172a`) color schemes to improve browser chrome theming on mobile.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Version sync and lockfile update across all packages (`@markdy/core`, `@markdy/renderer-dom`, `@markdy/astro`).

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `progressBar` option (`boolean`, default `true`) — renders a rainbow `conic-gradient` border that traces top→right→bottom→left as playback progresses.
- `copyright` option (`boolean`, default `true`) — renders a small "Powered by Markdy" link below the animation viewport.

### Fixed
- Compute the progress bar start angle from the scene aspect ratio so it visually starts at the top-left corner for non-square viewports.
- Place the copyright badge outside the scene container so it is not clipped by `overflow:hidden`.

### Docs
- Updated API tables and integration examples in README and package READMEs to document `copyright`, `progressBar`, and `loop`.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `copyright` option (`boolean`, default `true`) — renders a small "Powered by Markdy" link below the animation viewport, linking to markdy.com.
- `progressBar` option (`boolean`, default `true`) — renders a rainbow `conic-gradient` border that traces top→right→bottom→left as playback progresses.
- Both options are available in `createPlayer()` (`@markdy/renderer-dom`) and the `<Markdy />` Astro component.

### Fixed
- Copyright badge is now placed outside the container element to avoid `overflow:hidden` clipping.
- Rainbow progress bar starts from the top-left corner (315°).

### Docs
- Updated API tables in root README, `@markdy/renderer-dom` README, and `@markdy/astro` README to document `copyright`, `progressBar`, and `loop` options.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Bumped package versions to 0.5.0

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-11

- Release workflow documentation in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` with `pnpm run release <version>` in the Scripts table.

### Improved

### Changed
- Bump `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, and `pnpm/action-setup` from v4 to v6.
- Remove leftover `packages: write` permission from release workflow (GitHub Packages support was removed in v0.1.3).

### Fixed

- Remove dev-only scratch scripts (`run-preview.js`, `test-parse.js`) from the repository.
- Fix `cd markdy` → `cd markdy-com` in README Development section.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-11
